# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Engineering-Students-Feedback
The project is of our academic course-Information Retreival Techniques.
Our team of 4 members collected over 100 student feedback responses regarding their curriculum, difficulty level,teaching methods etc through google forms.
We created a dataset containing 8+feature columns such as Course Code,Feedback,Sentiment,Previous Experience,Gender,Attendance,Course Difficulty,Study Hours (per week),Overall Satisfaction,Department.
Preprocessed the data using all the NLP techniques to improve the quality of data.
We built a multiple linear regression model for the target varaible 'Subjectivity Score'.
After evaluating through different metrics, we achieved r2 score of 93% and extracted insights to improve teaching methods and subjects for student satisfaction.
